# SAC-Sagaan-AntiCheat-OverlayDetector-
This is a usermode program which basically scans windows to check if they are overlay. The program will scan for WS_VISIBLE, WS_EX_LAYERED, WS_EX_TRANSPARENT and any overlay which takes up >90% of the screen. Enjoy!

About SAC:

SAC is made by Me a.k.a Sagaan, who's goal in mind was to allow small developers access to an Anti Cheat without paying a sum of money to a top tier AC company such as Battleye or EAC. Make sure to Credit Me as he has put in alot of time and effort into making SAC. If you like to donate to show your support, go ahead. Paypal: theherobrine9@gmail.com
